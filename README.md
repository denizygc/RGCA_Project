Recycling Garbage Collector Application (RGCA)
RECYCLING GARBAGE COLLECTOR APPLICATION
This project is aimed at optimizing the collection of materials suitable for recycling in universities. This type of garbage types, the location of the garbage cans, the names of the employees involved in the waste bins and discharge points were optimized.
As a result of the social and economic activities of people, all kinds of substances that have expired and become harmful to nature are called waste. Materials such as cardboard, glass, metal, plastic can be classified as waste. Recycling of waste is only possible through recycling. Recycling is the recycling of these wastes, which have the possibility of re-use, to physical or chemical processes and converting them to a second raw material. The purpose of recycling is to prevent excessive use of resources, to ensure the separation of wastes in their sources, to reduce the amount of waste garbage.
Recycling of materials such as paper, cardboard, glass, plastic and metal will prevent the depletion of natural resources. Recycling, which contributes greatly to the economy of the country, will reduce the amount of foreign currency paid to imported scrap and will significantly save energy use. Recycling of used paper reduces air pollution by 74-94%, water pollution by 35% and water use by 45%. Adding 1 ton of waste paper to the pulp prevents 8 trees from being cut.
Recycling is a very efficient economic investment in the long run. Human beings are faced with many economic problems in the future as a result of the depletion of raw materials and natural resources. On the other hand, many recycled wastes will contribute to the prevention of environmental pollution.
Importance of Recycling;
•	Prevents the reduction of natural resources.
•	It provides energy saving.
•	The amount of solid waste to be disposed of is reduced.
•	Contributes to the economy.
•	It provides a clean environment for future generations.
•	It contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
•	Recycling of domestic wastes by composting method increases the soil yield. Thus, both organic and high nutritional products are obtained.
